            <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
            <h3>Vessels Built by The Captain </h3>
            <dd>The history of Snorkeling Puerto Rico began in 1968 when Captain Greg Korwek started to build the Innovation in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Innovation was owner built and owner-operated since 1971 in the bay of San Juan. It became the first vessel to transport more than six passengers as a commercial activity in Puerto Rico.</dd>
            <h3>The Innovation Arrives in Fajardo, Puerto Rico</h3>
            <dd>n 1988, Captain Greg Korwek moved the Innovation to Fajardo Puerto Rico. And he revolutionized the Nautical Tourism of Puerto Rico with that move. He started to serve routes from Fajardo to the islands of Icacos, Lobos, Palomino, and Palominitos for snorkeling and dive tours. This activity opened the doors for local seafarers that copied the recipe and were able to create their successful businesses as the nautical tourism in Fajardo began to thrive. </dd>
            <h3>The Transfer </h3>
            <dd>In 2016, Captain Greg Korwek decided to sell the company to Kayaking Puerto Rico, a company with high-quality standards owned by young Puerto Ricans. Captain Greg took this young and innovative company by the hands and taught them all he knew about the vessels.  

                Since he built and operated both vessels, he taught our maritime team everything he has done on the boats, from rebuilding engines to technical wooden hull repairs.
                
                The Innovation and The Fun Cat are US Coast Guard-inspected vessels. </dd>
            <h3>The Storm</h3>
            <dd>In September 2017, after only a year of operations under Kayaking Puerto Rico, category 5 Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico. Maria devastated the whole Island, and it was news that made headlines across the world. 

                We got hit with a huge blow. Our 55ft catamaran sank as a result of Hurricane Maria.</dd>
