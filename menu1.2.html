            Our Puerto Rico Boat Charter starts from Marina Puerto Chico. As we navigate Our Don Innovation among the Fajardo coastline, enjoy the views and information our interpretive guides will share. Approximately 20 minutes later, we’ll enter the Icacos Islands Nature Reserve, where you’ll spot the chain of islands that make this nature reserve special. Bring an underwater camera to capture the colorful schools of fish and sea life swimming through the vibrant and ancient limestone formations. Snorkeling for an hour and thirty minutes in the La Cordillera area gives you another perspective, with schools of sea life swimming through the coral reef formations. Snacks and drinks will be ready after you’ve snorkeled up an appetite. Enjoy the view over lunch as we exit the snorkeling site and navigate towards the world-famous Icacos Island Beach, where we will spend two hours. Then it’s back to the Marina.</dd>
